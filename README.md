# my-first-repo.
A repository for learning GitHub.

Some info about myself: I am currently studying to earn my degree in CS, and consider myself semi decent in Java, Python, and HTML. Currently I am working on improving my skills, and have many hobbies outside of school for fun (art with color pencils, video games, other programming projects such as building a video game and websites) as well!

Hope you like jumpscares.
